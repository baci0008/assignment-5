				<h2>China seeks to pacify middle class; boosts defense spending</h2>
				
				<p>BEIJING — China pledged to tackle problems which threaten to alienate the country's growing middle class and aspirational masses as its once-in-a-decade changing of the guard at the top of the country’s government got under way. "We should unwaveringly combat corruption, strengthen political integrity, establish institutions to end the excessive concentration of power and lack of checks on power and ensure that officials are honest, government is clean and political affairs are handled with integrity,"said China's outgoing premier Wen Jiabao at the China’s National People’s Congress (NPC).</p>
				
				<p>Wen on Tuesday enumerated major domestic challenges that have caused public discontent in recent years — air pollution, toxic factories, tainted food and abuses of power — and pledged more resources to environmental protection and public welfare. His speech was a tacit admission that quality of life had been sidelined by a focus on breakneck economic growth. "We are keenly aware we still face many difficulties and problems in our economic and social development," said the premier, whose family was accused in a New York Times report late last year of amassing billions of dollars in assets. </p>
