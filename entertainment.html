				<h2>'American Idol's' gentle criticism leads to a meltdown</h2>
				
				<p>Quirky Charlie Askew has been one of the most prominent “American Idol” guys so far in season 12. He’s appealingly eccentric with a big voice and a pleasant demeanor, but he’s also a 17-year-old kid who has always seemed like he’s one high-wire act away from collapsing. That collapse occurred on Wednesday night, as everything about his night was ill advised. As he performed Genesis' "Mama," he looked like a kid playing dress-up with his sleeveless top, ponytail and wispy mustache. He sounded like a cover singer in a random high-school garage band. Finally, and perhaps more worrisome, is that he shrank onstage and had a tough time holding it together upon hearing criticism that, in the “Idol” universe, wasn’t even all that harsh.</p>
				
				<p>“Something feels not fully genuine. It just feels disingenuous a little bit,” Keith Urban said. That’s something a kindly music teacher would tell a star student having a bad day, but Charlie looked devastated. “Last I time I saw you I wanted to cradle you in my arms,” Nicki Minaj said. But this time? Not so much. “I don’t want to see your arms, I don’t want you working out. Charlie! I don’t want to see that ponytail. I don't want to see that earring. Lose the mustache immediately, honey! Charlie, seriously, babe, I want my cute, cuddly Charlie back,” she said. Randy Jackson and Mariah Carey offered similar comments: gently critical, like what a parent would give to a high-school student. And Charlie looked sadder and sadder.</p>

					<h3>'Twilight's' got over 100 problems and Bella is one, say viral video critics</h3>
					
					<p>If you liked how they picked apart "Skyfall," you're going to love the way the folks at Cinema Sins completely shred 2008's "Twilight." The first entry in the vampire romance franchise may have a shorter running time than "Skyfall" (sin count 61) but apparently it has nearly twice as many things wrong with it.</p>
