				<h2>Six months after fungal meningitis outbreak, patients still get infections</h2>
				
				<p>Nearly six months after the start of a deadly fungal meningitis outbreak blamed on tainted pain shots, patients who originally tested clear are showing up sick, raising worries that the incubation period for illness may be longer than anyone thought. Though the flood of patients has slowed dramatically, two or three people each week are still reporting infections caused by contaminated steroids in the outbreak that has killed 48 and sickened more than 700, officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.</p>
				
				<p>Among those new patients are people who received mold-tainted doses of the drug methylprednisolone, but who previously got MRIs or lumbar punctures that showed they were free of infection. These slow-growing infections aren't as severe as meningitis, but worrying nonetheless.“If you had an MRI in October, I don’t know that you’re out of the woods,” said Dr. Anurag Malani, an infectious disease expert at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor, Mich., the state that has seen the most cases -- 253 -- in the outbreak.
CDC officials issued a health alert this week urging clinicians to remain vigilant for new infections, even in people who show subtle symptoms -- or none at all.</p>

					<h3>'Very red flag' over cancer center's survival claims</h3>
					
					<p>Cancer Treatment Centers of America reports survival rates better than the the national average. But those rates are misleading, say experts, and are a result, in part, of the company rejecting many elderly patients and the very sickest.</p>

					<h3>Stay active and you'll stay happy, study suggests</h3>
					
					<p>You're probably familiar with the post-workout feeling that, for the next little while, all is well with the world. That exercise-induced glow can wear off pretty quickly, of course, but does that mean that any happiness imparted by being inactivity is temporary and fleeting?</p>
