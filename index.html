				<h2>REPORT: NORTH KOREA ISSUES THREAT OF NUKE 'ATTACK'</h2>
				
				<p>Pyongyang ratchets up rhetoric ahead of U.N. vote on sanctions, issuing "pre-emptive" strike warning and claiming "the United States is about to ignite a nuclear war." "Since the United States is about to ignite a nuclear war, we will be exercising our right to pre-emptive nuclear attack against the headquarters of the aggressor in order to protect our supreme interest,'' the North's foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency. NBC News could not immediately confirm the statement. However, the remarks were also reported by media outlets including The Associated Press.On Wednesday, the South Korean military said it would strike back at North Korea and target its top leadership if Pyongyang attacks.</p>
				
				<p>Tensions have ratcheted higher across the Korean Peninsula since the North, under youthful leader Kim Jong Un who took office just over a year ago after the death of his father, launched a long-range rocket last December. He followed this with a third nuclear test on February 12, triggering the prospect of more U.N. sanctions that are due to be formally announced on Thursday after the United States and China, the North's one major diplomatic ally, struck a deal to punish Pyongyang. Earlier in the week, Pyongyang threatened to end the 60-year truce that ended the Korean war.</p>
